<tr><th bgcolor=99AAEE width=200><font color=ffffff>About the comic:<p><font size="2">Each minus strip is painted on a 15x20" piece of Illustration board. With this comic I am pretending I am making a comic strip for a newspaper in the early 20th century. A special newspaper that lets me use as much color as I want. I'm not much for comic strips so I don't know how long I'll be doing this one, so enjoy it while it lasts, I guess? It'll be updating every thursday until I suddenly stop! Making comics on giant paper is pretty neat though. Yeah.</font size> <br></font color>

22/6/2006 - Heeeeeeeeey... simple strip today. so I scanned this one in four parts on a regular scanner. There was a dark band down the center of the page which I couldn't avoid but I did my best to make it not too bad. Not that my best is very good but you know. <br><br>RSS feed is on the main kiwis by beat page now. Some guy was like "hey put up an rss feed" and I was like "ok." He suggested I use <a href="http://www.rsspect.com">RSSpect</a> and in a manner fitting for me, I didn't think about it at all until 11 PM tonight when I looked up an RSS tutorial. I laugh in the face of services provided for my convenience! And when I upload my comics to the interweb, I do not use an FTP program, I write the binary code in a sketchbook tear the pages out when I am done and ram it into the interweb with my fists! The feed is just the preview image that pops up with each update on the main page.<br>Even more stuff to say! What is going on! New comics! My plan was to start putting a new comic online this summer, and I've been working on it for the past few weeks. I mentioned it to a few people before, but I've changed my mind and will start putting it online at the beginning of next year probably. I want to update with around 10 pages per week and have as much of the comic done as I can before anything goes online. There's another comic I might start putting up this summer, but I might just save it for the 2007 comics revue. Depends on how much content I can get out of the idea.<br><br>What's this? More stuff to talk about here? That's right! I am plugging a website. <a href="http://www.drewweing.com/" target=blank>This guy is awesome.</a> Twice. I say that because I found two different comics at different times and thought "this is neat" before realizing they were by the same guy months later. <br><br>MORE TO SAY WHEN WILL I SHUT UP JEEZ. This is a milestone for minus! 20 strips! Boy, never thought I'd get here, you know? Except for how I had outlines for 20 strips a week or so after I started the comic! But I mean that list of outlines could have caught fire or who knows what! What? You say that 20 strips isn't a milestone number? But it's a multiple of 10 right? Doesn't matter? Oh. Sorry gang.<br><br><center>rezo</center></font color>
